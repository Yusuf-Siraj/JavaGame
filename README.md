A game called "Tamaro's Adventure: The Invincible Jump".

This can be played immediately just buy downloading and unziping the file and then using a code editor on your PC or laptop to start playing. 

This game was creatd using the City physics engine, that reqquired reading and understanding documentation and physics to implement into my actual game. 

Moreover, the game was built over a short period of time of around 2 months or so, but I had plenty of fun of doing so and I hope you enjoy playing as much as I did making it.
